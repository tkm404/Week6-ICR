# Week 6 Independent Code Review - Currency Exchanger (with API)

#### This program is a currency exchange calculator that uses an exchange rate API to give real-time results of differences in currency value.

#### By Thomas McDowell

## Technologies Used

JavaScript
HTML
CSS
Jest
webpack
npm
ES Linter

## Description
A user should be able to enter an amount in USD, then specify another currency and submit a form. The user should then see the total amount entered in the converted currency. Users should be able to convert USD into at least 5 other types of currency.
If the API call results in an error, the app should return a notification to the user that states what the error is (401, 404, etc.).
If a query response doesn't include the inputted currency, the application should return a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist.

## Setup/Installation Req's

Install all packages with: $ npm install.
Build the project using webpack with: $ npm run build
Start a new Dev server with: $ npm run start
Lint JS files in the src folder with: $ npm run lint

Remember to rename the relevant title tags in webpack and package.json with the title of current project.
